Given the number n, not greater than 100. Create the matrix of size n√ón and fill it by the following rule. Numbers 0 should be stored on the primary diagonal. The two diagonals, adjacent to the primary one, should contain numbers 1. The next two diagonals - numbers 2, etc.

Sample Input:

5

Sample Output:

0 1 2 3 4
1 0 1 2 3
2 1 0 1 2
3 2 1 0 1
4 3 2 1 0
